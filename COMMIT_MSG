feat(refactor, devops): Full modernization and Docker dev environment setup

This major refactoring updates the entire application to Angular v20 best practices and introduces a Docker-based development environment for simplified testing and setup.

Key Modernizations:
- Migrated all legacy control flow (*ngIf, *ngFor) to the new built-in syntax ( @if, @src/app/components/booking-form/booking-form.component.ts).
- Replaced all BehaviorSubjects with Signals for state management, eliminating the async pipe.
- Converted all @Input() decorators to modern, signal-based inputs (input(), input.required()).
- Enforced OnPush change detection across all components for significant performance gains.
- Standardized DI to use the modern inject() function.

Development Environment:
- Added Dockerfiles for both the frontend (UI) and backend (API).
- Created a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the entire application.
- Utilizes volumes for live-reloading, enabling non-developers to test changes easily after a `git pull` with a single `docker-compose up` command.

The application is now 100% compliant with modern Angular v20 standards and is significantly easier to set up and test for all team members.
